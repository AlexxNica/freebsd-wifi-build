# PROVIDE: autosize
# BEFORE: sysctl
# KEYWORD: firstbootonly

# This is a very quick hack to optionally do rootfs autosizing if
# it's required.
#
# It needs to be more complete - be a "firstboot" kind of thing;
# make it configurable based on the board rather than assuming
#   it's /dev/da0;
# resize the underlying partition too if needed;
# deal with gpt bugs with the resize not being fully visible, etc.
